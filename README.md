# GMLT Family Project Dashboard 🏠

**Get My Life Together** - A simple family project dashboard to help us stay organized and tackle our home improvement goals together!

## What's This? 🤷‍♂️

Just a basic static website (hosted on GitHub Pages) that helps our family track progress on our pest control and organization project. Nothing fancy - just some HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript to keep everyone in the loop.

## Features ✨

- **Progress Tracking**: See how we're doing with our 8-week project timeline
- **Epic Breakdown**: Visual progress for each room and task area
- **Resource Links**: Quick access to our planning documents and checklists
- **Analytics**: Because who doesn't love a good progress chart? 📊

## How to Use 🚀

1. Visit the site (it's just a static GitHub Pages site)
2. Check out the main dashboard for current progress
3. Click through to analytics for the detailed breakdown
4. Use the resource links to access planning documents

That's it! Simple family organization, digitized. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## GitHub Pages Setup 📝

This repo includes a `.nojekyll` file to tell GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing and serve the static files directly. If you're setting up your own version, just create an empty `.nojekyll` file in the root directory.
