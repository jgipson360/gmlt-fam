* *Overall cost:* Bed bug heat treatments in Los Angeles typically range from $1 to $3 per square foot, or $2,500 to $7,500 for an entire home.
*
* *Size of the infested area:* The primary factor determining cost is the size of the area requiring treatment. Larger homes or infestations spread across multiple rooms will naturally cost more.
* *Severity of the infestation:* Heavy infestations will require more intensive treatment and may increase the overall cost.
* *Clutter:* A cluttered space makes it harder for heat to circulate effectively and may require additional time and effort from the technicians, impacting the price.
* *Add-on services:* Some companies offer additional services like mattress encasements or follow-up chemical treatments, which will add to the total cost.
* *Company choice:* Prices may vary between different pest control companies. 

Cost comparison with other treatments

* *Heat treatment vs. Chemical:* Heat treatment is generally more expensive upfront than chemical treatments, but can often be done in a single day and is highly effective at eliminating all life stages, including eggs. Chemical treatments may be less expensive per visit, but often require multiple applications and may not kill eggs, increasing the risk of re-infestation.
* *Heat treatment vs. Steam:* Heat treatment treats the entire area and uses residual heat, while steam treatment targets specific areas and penetrates deep into fabrics but may require multiple treatments.
